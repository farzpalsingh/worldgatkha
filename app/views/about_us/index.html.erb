				<div class="aboutBotContent">
					<p>The present martial art form, Gatka, now a sport in India, is a style of fighting only with sticks between two Gatka players, intended to simulate the sword and focuses on infusing physical, spiritual and mental fitness. No sharp edged weapons are used in the transformed Gatka game. The martial art, in which Gatka (wooden stick) is used as a weapon, is called Gatkabaazi. Because the main weapon used in this martial art is Gatka, so people often call this martial art Gatka itself, instead of Gatkabaazi.</p>
					<p>The Panjab University at Lahore, now established at Chandigarh, is the pioneer university in Gatka sport as it had been organizing inter-college and inter-varsity Gatka tournaments in sports costume regularly before partition of India. Mr. K.S Akali had drafted Gatka rules for the University in 1936 for playing Gatka as a game. Gatka was being played as a game in the colleges of Punjab till 1972 but after this the Gatka suffered a lot as all the colleges & universities of Punjab discontinued its regular competitions. It was the Punjabi University Patiala that initiated to host its inter-college and university level Gatka competitions in the year 2001.</p>
					<p>On the pattern of 1936 rules, the Gatka Federation of India, a registered apex body, has for the first time, formulated and standardized the in-depth Gatka Rules and Regulations with pictorial guidelines in September 2009. It adopted the conventional sports costume (i.e. Track Suits or T-shirt with lower, Sneakers and a Headgear for protection) as a new dress code to play Gatka game in all competitions to make it a 'Cosmopolitan Sport' which was earlier almost on the verge of extinction.</p>
					<p>The Gatka Federation of India has been providing training to the budding Gatkebaaz through workshops, seminars and camps under the new Gatka rules. It's a humble effort to revive a forgotten and dying art having a historical significance. It is informed that the Punjab Olympic Association has recognised the Punjab Gatka Association. The Education Department, Government of Punjab has also incorporated the Gatka game into the Punjab schools and universities sports calendar on the persistent appeals of Punjab Gatka Association.</p>
					<p>The Punjab Gatka Association had constituted a Sikh Martial Art Research and Training Board (SMART Board) to grant scholarships to the aspiring research scholars doing Ph.D in the field of martial art, especially on Gatka in order to enrich the historical literature on Sikh martial art. Prominent personalities have been included into the SMART Board to verify and accept the research projects.</p>
					<p>The Gatka organisations are passionately desiring from the Punjab as well as Central Governments to award due gradations of Gatka game certificates at par with the certificates of other games.</p>

					<p>The natives captivated by martial art devised and developed fighting or defensive techniques with sticks on their motherlands as a method of training intended to simulate the swords such as the cavalry sabre or cutlass. In the USA during the early years of the 1900s, fencer, self-defence specialist and military engineer Andrew Chase Cunningham developed a unique system of stick-fighting using a walking stick, which he recorded in his book 'The Cane as a Weapon'.</p>
					<p>Single-stick was a popular pastime in the UK from the 18th to the early 20th century and was an event at the Summer Olympics 1904. With the passage of time, despite the interest in the art declined but competitions in stick-fighting was re-introduced into the Royal Navy in the 1980s by commander Locker Madden. The art continued to gain a following amongst the martial art community in the UK, Australia, Canada and the US.</p>
					<p>The origins of Martial Art are lost in antiquity but its purpose was primarily of self-defence. All martial arts on the globe shares a common root with other stick-fighting arts such as Stick-Fighting (USA), Arnis/Eskrima/Kali (Philippines), Gatka and Kalaripayattu (Indian), Singlestick (UK), Quarterstaff (European), Garrote Larense (Venezuelan), Stockfechten & Dussack (German), Kendo (Japanese) and Jogo do Pau or Juego del Palo (Portuguese), Donga/Sagenai (Ethopia), Intonga (South Africa), Bataireacht (Ireland), Aontroim Bataireacht (Canada, USA, Germany), etc. It is believed that Latin American & European stick-fighting arts were influenced by Indian dances or Indian martial arts.</p>
					<p>The B�ton Fran�ais, also known as French stick-fighting, is a European historical fencing discipline which uses a staff about 1.2 m long (4 ft). The techniques have much in common with Long-sword and Quarterstaff. The B�ton was systematized in France during the 19th century and is still part of a set of skills associated with the modern French martial art of Boxe Fran�aise (Savate).</p>
					<p>Canne de Combat is also a French martial art. As weapon, it uses a cane or canne (walking-stick) designed for fighting. Canne de Combat was developed in the early 19th century as a self-defence discipline and standardized in the 1970s for sporting competition. It is still being practised by French military and police forces.</p>
					<p>Latin America also has its share of martial arts devoted to stick-fighting like Jogo do Pau (Portuguese) martial art focusing on the use of a staff of fixed measures and characteristics. El Juego del Garrote or Garrote Larense is a Venezuelan martial art that involves machete, garrote, and knife fencing.</p>
					<p>Eskrima/Arnis/Kali is the traditional martial art of the Philippines, which emphasize weapon-based fighting with sticks, knives and other bladed weapons, and various improvised weapons. Knowledge of the Filipino fighting skills is mandatory in the Philippine military and police.</p>

						<li><b>DAHL OR SHIELD</b> : It is nearly always round and varies in diameter from about eight inches to about twenty-four. Some are very nearly flat while others are strongly convex. The edges may be flat or rolled back in the reverse curvature of the shield. It is held by two handles fastened to ring bolds that pass through the shield and are riveted to bosses on the outside, sometimes formed to spikes. Between the handles there is a square cushion for the knuckles to rest against. The handles are so placed that, when tightly grasped, they force the backs of the fingers against the cushion giving a very firm and comfortable hold. These shields are nearly always of steel or leather. </li>

						<li><b>LATHI</b> : The lathi or quarterstaff is a wooden stick as tall as the warrior and made of oak. </li>
						<li><b>MARATI</b> : The Marati is a bamboo stick with wooden or cloth balls on its ends. It is mainly used for training purposes but there are variations with blades or burning cloth on its ends, to attack and distract elephants and for psychological warfare. </li>
						<li><b>SOTI</b> : This is made from fire hardened bamboo or ratan, 1m long and usually has a hand guard. It is mainly used for practice and �playing Gatka�, the training fight. For combat they were replaced by oak ore ironwood sticks, without hand guards. </li>
						<li><b>TAPAR</b> : The battle-axe is very distinct from the normal axe and sometimes has a dagger concealed in the handle. </li>
						<li><b>TALWAR</b> : The sword is usually curved with a thin and sharp blade. The Talwar is greatly respected and treated with care.</li>
